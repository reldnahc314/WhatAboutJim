    <p style="text-align:justify">What About Jim is the latest project by Nashville recording artists Ashton Lee and Courtney Kaye. The two decided to officially join forces after a string of successful shows around Colorado's Front Range region as the Ashton Lee Band. The band's lineup is completed by Nashville studio drummer Blake Watts and ace Denver bassist Travis Owens. Blake began touring with Ashton's band Hidden Still in late 2015 and has been a major collaborator in Ashton's musical endeavors ever since. The seeds for What About Jim were planted when Ashton and Blake toured as the lead guitarist and drummer in Courtney's band Shoot The Jukebox in Summer 2017. The three musicians relocated to Denver in Fall 2017 and recruited Travis to play some shows they had lined up to gain footing in the Denver scene. The chemistry was undeniable, and the group is now planning a new album to be released in Summer 2018. With influences ranging from Traditional Country and Bluegrass to Classic R&B, Rock and Funk, What About Jim provides a soulful concert experience complete with studio-musician class and jam-band energy.
